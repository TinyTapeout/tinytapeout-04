# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

    ChipTune implements an 8-bit Programmable Sound Generator.
    Input is from a serial UART interface.
    Output is PWM audio.
