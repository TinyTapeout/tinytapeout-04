# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  language:     "Wokwi" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  description:  "Displays UCHILE-FCFM- into the 7-segment display"      # Short description of what your project does

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      It uses a Ripple Counter made from DSR flip-flops to count each character from UCHILE-FCFM- and displays it into the 7-segment display, the logic behind was optimized using the Quine McCluskey algorithm.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      You can test the desing by stepping the clock to see UCHILE-FCFM- in the 7-segment display. Also you can disable the counter with the 3th input and input a counter value by hand using the 4th to 7th inputs.

# A description of what the inputs do (e.g. red button, SPI CLK, SPI MOSI, etc).
  inputs:               
    - clock
    - reset
    - none
    - counter_disable
    - A (most significant bit of the counter)
    - B
    - C
    - D (least significant bit of the counter)
# A description of what the outputs do (e.g. status LED, SPI MISO, etc)
  outputs:
    - segment a
    - segment b
    - segment c
    - segment d
    - segment e
    - segment f
    - segment g
    - dot
# A description of what the bidirectional I/O pins do (e.g. I2C SDA, I2C SCL, etc)
  bidirectional:
    - none
    - none
    - none
    - none
    - none
    - none
    - none
    - none
