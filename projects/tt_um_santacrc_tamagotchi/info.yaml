# How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
# Before changing this, please reach out to us on discord to discuss your design.

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      Connect rx and tx to a serial terminal. The game will start automatically, if the tamagotchi dies, press the reset button to start again.
      feed all the stats to keep the tamagotchi alive (food, sleep, happiness, hygiene, social), when the tamagotchi are sleeping, you cannot interact with it.
      Controls:
      - E: feed
      - S: sleep
      - P: play
      - B: clean
      - T: talk
      - W: wake up


# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Use a 27MHz clock. Connect rx and tx to a serial terminal. The game will start automatically, if the tamagotchi dies, press the reset button to start again.
