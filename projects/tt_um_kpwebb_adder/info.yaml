# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  language:     "RustHDL"
  description:  "A (tiny) 8 bit adder built using RustHDL"

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
    Adds two 8 bit inputs (ui_in and uio_in) together to and outputs via uo_out. Implementation was written in rust using Rust-HDL and exported as verilog

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
    set ui_in and uio_in and toggle reset line
      

# A description of what the inputs do (e.g. red button, SPI CLK, SPI MOSI, etc).
  inputs:               
    - input a bit 0
    - input a bit 1
    - input a bit 2
    - input a bit 3
    - input a bit 4
    - input a bit 5
    - input a bit 6
    - input a bit 7
# A description of what the outputs do (e.g. status LED, SPI MISO, etc)
  outputs:
    - a + b bit 0
    - a + b bit 1
    - a + b bit 2
    - a + b bit 3
    - a + b bit 4
    - a + b bit 5
    - a + b bit 6
    - a + b bit 7
# A description of what the bidirectional I/O pins do (e.g. I2C SDA, I2C SCL, etc)
  bidirectional:
    - input b bit 0
    - input b bit 1
    - input b bit 2
    - input b bit 3
    - input b bit 4
    - input b bit 5
    - input b bit 6
    - input b bit 7
