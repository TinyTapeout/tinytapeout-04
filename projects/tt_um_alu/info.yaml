project:
  wokwi_id:    0        # If using wokwi, set this to your project's ID

# If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here. 
# Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately
  source_files:        
      - circuit.v
  top_module:  "tt_um_alu"      # Put the name of your top module here, must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username

# How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "1x1"    # Valid values: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 4x2 or 8x2

# Keep a track of the submission yaml

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.
#
# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  author:       "Angelo Machorro"      # Your name
  title:        "4-bit-alu"      # Project title
  language:     "Verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  description:  "4 bit alu "      # Short description of what your project does

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      Its a 4-bit alu, can make addition, substraction, multiplication, division and bitwise-and.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
    A and B input are the data for ALU, S is the operation selects, in the next table we presents the operations
    
    | operation | S |  Result |
    |---------|------|-|
    addition | 0 | A + B|
    |substraction| 1 | A - B|
    | multiplication| 2 | A * B|
    | division | 3 |  A/B |
    | bitwise and | 4 |A & B|
