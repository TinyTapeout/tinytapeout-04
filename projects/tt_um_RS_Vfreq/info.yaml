# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  title:        "CLK Frequency Divider"      # Project title
  language:     "Verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  description:  "Generates several frequency clock signals from a user-selected M module"      # Short description of what your project does

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      The frequency divider consists of a counter module M chosen by the user as an input to the project. When the counter reaches the value M-1, a signal is enabled which will function as a clock of another 7-bit counter and each output of this counter can be used as a clock signal, each signal is divided by 2 in frequency. The pulse of the M module counter was enabled as output but it is not recommended to use it as clock signal, but it can be used in other applications.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      To test the design you only need to choose the M module with the switches on the dedicated inputs.
