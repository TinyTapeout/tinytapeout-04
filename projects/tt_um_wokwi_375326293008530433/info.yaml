#  top_module:  "tt_um_example"      # Put the name of your top module here, must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username

# How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      It is a simple implementation of one D-flip-flop, three D-flip-flops with TMRed outputs and a single TMRed D-flip-flop that allows to inject errors.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Set inputs, trigger clock and observe outputs

# A description of what the inputs do (e.g. red button, SPI CLK, SPI MOSI, etc).
