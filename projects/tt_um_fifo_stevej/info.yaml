  how_it_works: |
    A FIFO queue is a first-in, first-out digital device that allows two parties to communicate with a channel of limited size by following specific rules: one party writes, the other reads. The first thing written will be the first thing read. Reading an empty queue is disallowed and writing to a full queue is disallowed. Empty and full status can be checked via the proper status pin before use.
    In psuedo-code, two parties can communicate with this FIFO as follows:

    Party A
    ```
    while !full:
      write_entry(item)
    ```

    Party B
    ```
    while !empty:
      item = read_entry()
    ```

    The queue works in First-Word Fall-Through mode meaning that the top item is always available on the read bus even
    if you haven't set `read_request` high. If you want to see the next item in the queue on your next read, be sure
    to set `read_request` high.

    `almost_full` and `almost_empty` signals exist so you can batch reads and writes. Instead of checking for
    `full` or `empty` on each read or write you can instead check `almost_full` or `almost_empty` and batch read or writes
    based on how many slots are available. For this design taped out in TinyTapeout 4, almost_full means 28 of 32 slots
    have been used and almost_empty means that 28 of 32 slots are free.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Write an item, read an item. Check the status bits. See the unit tests for more ideas!

# A description of what the inputs do (e.g. red button, SPI CLK, SPI MOSI, etc).
  inputs:
    - item[0]
    - item[1]
    - item[2]
    - item[3]
    - item[4]
    - item[5]
    - item[6]
    - item[7]
# A description of what the outputs do (e.g. status LED, SPI MISO, etc)
  outputs:
    - item[0]
    - item[1]
    - item[2]
    - item[3]
    - item[4]
    - item[5]
    - item[6]
    - item[7]
# A description of what the bidirectional I/O pins do (e.g. I2C SDA, I2C SCL, etc)
  bidirectional:
    - empty (read-only)
    - full (read-only)
    - underflow (read-only)
    - overflow (read-only)
    - almost_empty (read-only)
    - almost_full (read-only)
    - write_enable (set this high to write a value)
    - read_enable (set this high to read the latest entry from the FIFO)
