# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      This project uses the CLK input to generate a VGA output, this will default to a Random noise output, the output can be set to a background colour using the SPI interface.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      The design has been simulated and tested with the eric eastwood simulator using the output generated by tb.v. The output will be tested using a Basys 3 board prior to the final sumbission time permitting.
      The design is currently set up to output a 640x480 60Hz VGA signal. The output is currently set to a random test pattern.
      The design will have a way to adjust background colour, and draw onto the display using a few basic SPI commands. (Not yet implemented)
