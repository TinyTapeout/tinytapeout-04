# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  how_it_works: |
    Grain-Flex-FPGA is a 1 CLB FPGA with 8 IO buffers. The single CLB has four 4 input LUTs each with an optional flipflop at the output.
    The CLB has four inputs and four outputs that can be mapped to any IO buffer. Each LUT input pin can be mapped to any CLB input or
    any other LUT's output including its own. 

  # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test: |
    The FPGA is programmed with a simple scan chain. The SpinalHDL project has a few examples of creating a bit stream. (Hopefully VTR support coming soon)
