# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  how_it_works: |
      Our Neuron is a component that emulates the behavior of an artificial neuron. It is a simple demonstration with 2 inputs of 2 bits that emulate the inputs of the neuron and 2 inputs of 2 bits that emulate the corresponding weights. These weights would simulate values that have already been calculated, that is, the inference state. As an activation function, a small test with a linear comparator was proposed. The output of the neuron is one or zero depending on the value of the inputs and the weights.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      To test the neuron, values must be placed on the 2 2-bit inputs and on the two weight values. The system generates an output at 1 or 0 that represents activation or not of the neuron.
