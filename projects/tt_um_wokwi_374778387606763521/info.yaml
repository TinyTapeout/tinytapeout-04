  wokwi_id:    374778387606763521        # If using wokwi, set this to your project's ID

# If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here. 
# Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately
#  source_files:        
#    - counter.v
#    - decoder.v
#  top_module:  "tt_um_example"      # Put the name of your top module here, must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username

# How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "1x1"    # Valid values: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 4x2 or 8x2

# Keep a track of the submission yaml
yaml_version: 4

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.
#
# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  author:       "Rebeca Orellana, Abigail Alarcon"      # Your name
  title:        "PWM Quisquilloso"      # Project title
  language:     "Wokwi" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  description:  "Regulates the power or velocity at which a device functions. This PWM was designed to work with an extern clock of 12.5 KHz so the exit has a frequency of 50 Hz and it can control a servomotor."      # Short description of what your project does

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: | 
      Receives an 8 bits entrance, which the first is conected from a clock made with logicgates. The next bit is linked to the continuation of the clock and so on, with OR entrance that allow comparing the entry numbers until forming just one number written in binary that indicates the time. This has led lights connected in the output to check the clock account.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  | 
      Enter a value at the entries between 0 and 255 to determinate the working cycle.
