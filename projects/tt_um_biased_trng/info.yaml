  how_it_works: |
      This design is a close adaptation of the concept presented by:

      Minh-Hai Nguyen; Cong-Kha Pham
      A wide frequency range and adjustable duty cycle CMOS ring voltage controlled oscillator
      https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5670690

      This design has seven 7-stage ring oscillators that have a final stage NAND which is takes as input
      the inverter chain and the `ena` wire - that is, the oscillator should only run when `ena` is high.

      The oscillators are all tied at their NAND-outputs to a single node which passes the signal
      through an "inverter bias" system that are biased using Harald Pretl's vDAC system which uses
      the first 4 input pins to select a voltage:

      https://github.com/iic-jku/tt03-tempsensor/tree/main/src

      Note: This circuit is only active when `ena` is enabled.

      The inverter-bias system pass through two D-flip flops connected in series with their `set` signals tied high
      and `reset` being connected to the `rst_n` control wire and their clocks being controlled by `CLK`. Finally,
      these are passed through a `ena`-enabled `AND` which gates the final output of the TRNG.
