# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  description:  "It was meant to be a final project, but that was undercut."      # Short description of what your project does

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      It's a PID block to be configured with I2C. GPIOs 7 through 2 are for error/control, and GPIOs 1 and 0 are SDA and SCL.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Configure with the I2C frame, see the I2C files for the "addresses". See the I2C test file for an example.
