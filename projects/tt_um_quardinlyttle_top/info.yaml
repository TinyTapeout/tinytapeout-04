  how_it_works: |
      4 bit Op Code ALU. OpCodes are as follows- 
      
       - 0000 AND
       
       - 0001 OR
       
       - 0010	NOT
       
       - 0011	XOR
       
       - 0100	NAND
       
       - 0101	NOR
       
       - 0110	XNOR
       
       - 0111	Addition
       
       - 1000	Subtraction
       
       - 1001	Multiplication
       
       - 1010	Compare
       
       - 1011	Shift L Logically
       
       - 1100	Shift R Logically
       
       - 1101	Shift L Arithmetically

       - 1110	Shift R Arithmetically
       
       - 1111	Running Sum
       
       
       **Running Sum** takes the current 4bit number at the input and continously adds it to the output every second. 

       
       **Compare** is 2'b10 when A is greater than B, 2'b01 when B is greater than A. 2'b11 when equal.

       
       **NOT** treats A and B as a combined 4bit input. 

       
       **Subtraction** anticipates am unsigned number input  (treats them as positive numbers essentially) however will give signed output depending on the operation. It acts as A-B. 

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Testing can be done by connecting the outputs to LEDs and treating them as an 8 bit output. Seeing how they correspond to the selected OpCodes and inputs. 

# A description of what the inputs do (e.g. red button, SPI CLK, SPI MOSI, etc).
  inputs:               
    - OpCode 0
    - OpCode 1
    - OpCode 2
    - OpCode 3
    - B 0
    - B 1
    - A 0
    - A 1
# A description of what the outputs do (e.g. status LED, SPI MISO, etc)
  outputs:
    - segment a
    - segment b
    - segment c
    - segment d
    - segment e
    - segment f
    - segment g
    - dot
# A description of what the bidirectional I/O pins do (e.g. I2C SDA, I2C SCL, etc)
  bidirectional:
    - Output bit 0
    - Output bit 1
    - Output bit 2
    - Output bit 3
    - Output bit 4
    - Output bit 5
    - Output bit 6
    - Output bit 7
