# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  title:        "PWM audio"
  language:     "Verilog"
  description:  "Takes in 8-bit audio over a parallel (port) interface then generates an analog audio signal like a Covox Speech Thing."

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
    This is meant as a parallel port sound card like a Covox Speech Thing. Instead of R-2R resistors, the chip will generate the analog audio output using PWM and First-order sigma-delta modulator.
 

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      No particular test required.

# A description of what the inputs do (e.g. red button, SPI CLK, SPI MOSI, etc).
  inputs:               
    - Bit 0 of Parallel port (LSB)
    - Bit 1 of Parallel port
    - Bit 2 of Parallel port
    - Bit 3 of Parallel port
    - Bit 4 of Parallel port
    - Bit 5 of Parallel port
    - Bit 6 of Parallel port
    - Bit 7 of Parallel port (MSB)

# A description of what the outputs do (e.g. status LED, SPI MISO, etc)
  outputs:
    - Standard PWM audio output
    - Sigma-delta modulator output
    - From ena pin
    - From clk pin
