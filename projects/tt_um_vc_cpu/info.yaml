project:
  wokwi_id:    0        # If using wokwi, set this to your project's ID

# If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here. 
# Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately

    - tt_um_vc_cpu.v
    - vc.v
  top_module:  "tt_um_vc_cpu"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "1x2"    # Valid values: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 4x2 or 8x2

# Keep a track of the submission yaml
yaml_version: 4

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.
