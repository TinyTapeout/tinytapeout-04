  wokwi_id:    347140425276981843        # If using wokwi, set this to your project's ID

# If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here. 
# Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately

#  top_module:  "tt_um_example"      # Put the name of your top module here, must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by prepending your github username

# How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
# Before changing this, please reach out to us on discord to discuss your design.
  tiles: "1x1"    # Valid values: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 4x2 or 8x2

# Keep a track of the submission yaml

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  description:  |
      This circuit will output a string of characters (’tiny tapeout’) to the uart.

  how_it_works: |
      Supports ASCII characters from 0x40 (@) to 0x5F (_), including capital letters from the latin alphabet.
# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
    Example Sending 'A'
    1. Set the Arduino serial baud rate `Serial.begin(<baud rate>);` in the *.ino file to 300
    2. Set the Wokwi clock frequency `"attrs": { "frequency": "300" }` in the diagram.json to 300 as well
    3. Set SW7 to OFF ("Load")
    4. Set SW2 to ON and SW3-6 to OFF
    5. Set SW7 to ON ("TX")
    6. Set SW8 to ON ("Output Enable")
    If there's no output from the Wokwi Arduino serial monitor, try toggling SW7 OFF and ON again.
    Congratulations! You should now see the letter being output in the Wokwi Arduino Serial monitor at the bottom of the simulation.
    Note that garbage characters may be printed upon initialization.
