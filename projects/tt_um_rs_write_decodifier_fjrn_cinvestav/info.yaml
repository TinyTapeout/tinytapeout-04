# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  author:       "Francisco Javier Rodriguez Navarrete"      # Your name
  title:        "RS Write Decodifier"      # Project title
  language:     "Verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  description:  "Project for the 12 bit reservation station decodifier"      # Short description of what your project does

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
    It works via selecting the corresponding RS needed
   
# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test: |
    Manupulate the input switches to see the decodifier outputs

# A description of what the inputs do (e.g. red button, SPI CLK, SPI MOSI, etc).
