# How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.
#
# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  description:  "ROM with information about the chip"   # Short description of what your project does

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      ROM memory that contains information about the Tiny Tapeout chip: Shuttle name, Git repository, last GitHub commit, etc.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      You can read the ROM contents by setting the address pins and reading the data pins. 
      Some of the ROM contents is 7-segment encoded, so you can directly see the data by toggling the DIP switches
      and observing the on-board 7-segment display.
